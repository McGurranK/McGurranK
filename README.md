# Hi there, I'm Kris â€” an Irish C++ developer, musician & tinkerer ðŸ‘‹

## Commercial Work

- Developed cross-platform audio plugins (VST3, AU, AAX) using JUCE at Sonnox.
- Contributed to GUI updates, ports, and maintenance across 19 commercial audio products.
- Focused on real-time safe DSP code, reactive audio visualisations, and performance improvements.
- Much of my work is confidential until product releases or maintaince updates

## Personal Projects

- **VectorisedWrapper** - Wrapper around vectorisation functions (VDSP & in the future intel IPP).
- **Atesh** â€” A noisy audio plugin inspired by my desire for mixer feedback inside a VST.
- **DelayPlugin** â€” A delay effect with a unique wet/dry mix visualization built with JUCE DSP.
- **Bit Delay** â€” A bit crusher within a delay feedback loop, developed through experimental sound design.
- **VIVI** â€” My undergraduate project focused on creating accessible synthesizers for visually impaired musicians using C++.

## Skills & Interests

- C++ (modern standards, cross-platform development)
- Python scripting for repetive tasks
- JUCE framework for audio plugins
- DSP and real-time safe audio programming
- Build systems with CMake, version control with Git
- Passionate about accessibility and designing for accessibility in software

## Currently Working On

- I'm working on some tooling, but am focused on using TDD to put some aspects of the tooling together.
